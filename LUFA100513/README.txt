This package contains the complete LUFA library, demos, user-submitted projects
and bootloaders for use with compatible microcontroller models. To get started,
you will need to install the "Doxygen" documentation generation tool from
www.doxygen.org, and run "make doxygen" from the command line whilst inside the
extracted LUFA download package directory. From there, the generated Doxygen 
HTML documentation for the library and included projects will be available in the
generated Documentation/ subdirectories of the library core and projects. View
the generated documentation for the library core in your chosen web browser for
further Getting Started information.

The documentation for the library itself (but not the documentation for the
individual demos, projects or bootloaders) is also available as a separate
package from the project webpage for convenience if Doxygen cannot be installed.
