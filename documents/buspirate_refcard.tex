%% This LaTeX-file generates a reference card for the bus-pirate found at  
%% dangerousprototypes.com The size is the same as the PCB board of the bus-pirate (V3) 
%%
%% Mini-HowTo
%% 1. Change the colours below to the colours of your individual prober-cable
%% 2. Execute LaTeX to generate a PDF (either by using your LaTeX IDE or by running
%%    'latex buspirate_refcard.tex' on the command line
%% 3. Print the pdf (switch of any scaling functions in your printer settings)
%% 4. Glue the refcard to a cardboard and either fix it on the rear-side of the
%%    bus-pirate or on a enclosure if you use one.
%%
%% It requires a working LaTeX environment and the LaTeX package pgf/tikz
%% pgf/tikz is available here:
%%    http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=pgf
%% or in any actual TeXlive distribution.

%% define colours here 
%% colours are given in normed RGB values
%% whereas (0,0,0) indicates all minimum (black) and (1,1,1) all maximum (white)
%% e.g., \definecolor{MISO}{rgb}{0,0,0}
%% alternatively use 0-255 values by defining the colours with a capital [RGB] parameter
%% e.g., \definecolor{CLK}{RGB}{255,127,0}
%% do not change the given colour names since they correspond to the individual pin
%% most likely you have simply to switch the given colours below
